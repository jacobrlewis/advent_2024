**SPOILERS**

debug.txt has a solution of 1

If your solution does not test that a loop can be reached, you will get 2. I didn't understand that the obstacle had to be placed before the guard started moving. I thought it could be placed at any point, which made my first attempts too high.

Once I realized this was an assumption made, I realized you never need to test the same coordinate twice.
